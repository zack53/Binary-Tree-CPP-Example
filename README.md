# Binary-Tree-CPP-Example
The purpose of the code is to extend code from the CMSC 330 text book to allow for more operations on an arithmetic expression. The extension allows for the relational, logical, and conditional expression operators as described in the Project-Description.pdf. If you have any questions, contact me at zack.scott9889@gmail.com.
